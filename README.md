Managing Dependencies

Dependencies: These are packages required for your project to function correctly in a production environment.

The project uses libraries such as react, react-dom, react-icons, react-router-dom, react-slick, sass, and slick-carousel.

DevDependencies: These are packages required for development, such as linters and build tools.

The project uses packages such as @types/react, @types/react-dom, @vitejs/plugin-react-swc, eslint, eslint-plugin-react, eslint-plugin-react-hooks, and vite.

Additional Notes

Vite's documentation can be helpful if you encounter any issues with the build tool.

Each package in your dependencies and devDependencies has its own documentation for usage instructions and best practices. Refer to them as needed.
